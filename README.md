 Synaptica PHP WS client
=========================

Uses the MIT licence (http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php)

This library offers a starting point for interacting with [synaptica](http://www.synaptica.com/ "Synaptica Website"), a taxonomy and metadata management software.

It simply uses PHP5 SoapClient mechanism to interact with the various SOAP webservices that Synaptica product expose to outside applications.

I did use [wsdl2phpgenerator](https://github.com/walle/wsdl2phpgenerator) to generate all the proxy classes from the WSDL. IT was very very useful! Thanks a bunch for the time saver!
